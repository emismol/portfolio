# Emily's portfolio

## Instructions / Assets
Create a portfolio from scratch. The portfolio is complete when it is loaded and the viewer is shown my name, an image of me, and links to sections about me, examples of my work, and a contact me section.
The links take the user to the appropriate section sucessfully. When a project image is clicked it should take the user to the corresponding project. The first project image is larger than the rest. All the project images are titled. When the page is resized on various devices it should adjust accordingly.
